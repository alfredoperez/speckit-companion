## Instructions

Implement the feature directly based on the spec and plan. This is a streamlined version without formal task management.

1. **Read context**:
   - `specs/{feature}/spec.md` - requirements
   - `specs/{feature}/plan.md` - implementation approach

2. **Implement directly**:
   - Follow the plan's implementation steps
   - Make changes to the files identified
   - Write tests as you go

3. **Skip**:
   - Task file generation
   - Phase-by-phase breakdown
   - Progress tracking in tasks.md
   - Formal task completion markers

4. **When complete**, summarize:
   - Files changed
   - Tests added
   - Any deviations from plan

This lightweight implementation is for small features where formal task tracking adds overhead. Use `/speckit.implement` for larger features requiring structured progress tracking.
