# Capture Step Start

Run this from the repository root, passing the step that is about to run (specify, plan, tasks or implement) as `--step`; if `python3` is missing, say the step was not recorded and carry on.

```bash
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --hook start --step <step>
```
