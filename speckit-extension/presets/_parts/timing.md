## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Never hand-edit `.spec-context.json`.** Record every finish by **running the writer script**, never by editing the JSON file yourself — a hand-authored edit is what corrupts the file (a duplicated `status` key). The script stamps the real clock, writes atomically, and is idempotent. The commands below are the only way you touch timing.
- **Self-close — clarify and analyze only.** When your own work for **clarify or analyze** ends, record the step finish (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <this step> --finish --by ai
  ```

  `--finish` appends a single step-level complete and touches **nothing else** (it leaves `status`/`currentStep` to the lifecycle hooks). Do NOT self-close **specify, plan, tasks, or implement**: the extension stamps both of those steps' boundaries itself — specify and implement from their own command bodies, plan and tasks from a body-recorded start plus the after-step hook's completion. A step-level `ai` complete there would land first, and because the completion append is idempotent (first writer wins), it would permanently block the hook's extension-stamped close and leave the step's duration untrusted.
- **Substeps — one finish each, via the script.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`), the moment that substep ends, run:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <step> --substep <name> --finish --by ai
  ```

  One call per substep, each stamped with its own real clock at the moment it finishes — never two substeps in one batch, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — finishing a task *is* logging it (finish-only).** Recording a task's finish is the **closing action of that task**, done the instant its work is complete and before you start the next one — not a bookkeeping pass you batch at the end of a phase. The closing action is a single append (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one-line summary of what this task did>" --files "<comma,separated,files,touched>" --append
  ```

  `--append` writes **one line** to `.spec-context.events.jsonl` and does **not** read or rewrite the shared `.spec-context.json`, so it never hits the "read the file first" retry and **parallel workers can each append their own finish at the same time without contending** — the line carries its own real timestamp (`date -u` is stamped by the script). The `--did`/`--files` flags ride along so the Activity panel's Tasks card is populated from the script. **Do NOT hand-edit the `- [ ]` checkbox in `tasks.md`** — the script owns it: materialize flips it to `- [x]` from your appended finish, so a fanned-out subagent only appends and never touches the shared `tasks.md`. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON and do NOT write a per-task `start`.

  Then **fold the appended lines into `.spec-context.json` — per task, the moment each finish lands.** The fold is the second half of the task's closing action, run by the **MAIN agent only**, in the foreground, one task at a time — for your own task right after its append, and for a fanned-out worker's task the moment its result returns:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --materialize
  ```

  `--materialize` is the one read-modify-write: it folds the finishes into the panel **and checks off the matching `tasks.md` boxes** for every journaled task, idempotently (re-folding never double-counts). The panel only sees folded finishes — the append log is not watched — so folding per task is what makes progress advance task by task instead of jumping in end-of-wave bursts. Workers never run `--materialize` (that would put two writers on the shared file); they only append, and the MAIN agent serializes every fold. Run it once more at each wave join as a backstop, and the end-of-step hook materializes anything left and fills any task you didn't journal. What's trustworthy here is the **per-task summary** (`did`/`files`) and the order tasks completed, plus the **step-level** start→complete span, which the scripts stamp exactly. The per-task *timestamps* are best-effort — they reflect when each finish was recorded, not a precisely measured duration; that's fine, the summaries are the point.
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".
