## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    
    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Least code — the smallest thing that actually works

Adapted from [Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail), which measured 54% fewer lines, 22% fewer tokens and 27% less time across twelve feature tasks with safety held at 100%.

**Climb this ladder and stop at the first rung that holds.** Does it need to exist at all; is it already in this codebase; does the standard library do it; does the platform do it, a date input over a picker library, CSS over JavaScript, a constraint over application code; does a dependency the project already has; can it be one line; only then, the minimum code that works.

**Fix the cause, not the symptom.** A report names one caller and the fix usually belongs where they all pass through, which is both the smaller change and the only one that leaves no sibling broken.

**Delete rather than add, and boring rather than clever.** No interface with one implementation, no factory for one product, no configuration for a value that never changes, no scaffolding for a later that can scaffold itself.

**The same ladder governs what you write, not just what you build.** A spec, plan, research note, data model, contract or task list is only worth its length if a reader acts on it. Do not restate what another artifact in this feature already says, do not write a requirement for what a type or a test already enforces, and do not add a third acceptance scenario unless it covers a failure the first two miss. A section with nothing to say is removed, never filled with "N/A" — and the recorded size is the budget, so a `simple` change gets the tasks without the ceremony around them.

**Never simplify away** validation at a trust boundary, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility, or anything the spec asks for. This shortens the solution, never the reading: understand the whole path before choosing a rung.

**Name a corner you cut on purpose** with `// simplified: <the ceiling>, <what to do when it binds>` in the code, and one matching `concerns` entry in this step's capture, so "later" has somewhere to be found.

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
   - Record the **implement START** so the step's duration begins now (the script stamps the real clock; the end-of-step hook records each task and closes the step — do not hand-write implement timing):
     ```bash
     python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir FEATURE_DIR --step implement --status implementing --kind start --by extension
     ```

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`

   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `autom4te.cache/`, `config.status`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`

   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__` first to regenerate the task list.

10. **Check for extension hooks**: After completion validation, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
    - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key
    - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
    - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
    - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
      - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
      - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
    - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
      - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
        ```
        ## Extension Hooks

        **Optional Hook**: {extension}
        Command: `/{command}`
        Description: {description}

        Prompt: {prompt}
        To execute: `/{command}`
        ```
      - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
        ```
        ## Extension Hooks

        **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
        Executing: `/{command}`
        EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
        ```
    - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

Record every boundary by **running the writer script**, never by editing `.spec-context.json` yourself — a hand-authored edit is what corrupts the file. The model is **finish-only**: one finish per task and per substep, its duration the gap back to the previous finish. Never a `start`+`complete` pair for either, which stamps a `0s` tick and measures nothing.

- **Close your own step**, as the last thing you do, after emitting any mandatory after-hook block:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <this step> --advance --by ai
  ```

  `--advance` appends the step's complete and flips `status` in one atomic write. It is idempotent and first-writer-wins, so it changes nothing when the after-hook already closed the step — and when the hook was *printed* rather than dispatched, which is indistinguishable downstream, it is the only thing that closes it. One run sat at `status: tasking` for eight minutes that way. Run it every time, with two exceptions: **clarify** and **analyze** use `--finish`, which records a boundary without owning a status; and **implement** runs neither, because its own final node writes `completed`, which closes the step in the same write.

- **One finish per substep, the moment it ends** — plan records `research` and `design`, tasks records `generate`. Never two in one batch, never a separate start.

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <step> --substep <name> --finish --by ai
  ```

- **Closing a task is that task's last action, not a bookkeeping pass you batch later.** Feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --close-task <TaskID> --by ai --did "<one line>" --files "<files>"
  ```

  One call appends the finish with its own real clock, folds it into the panel, and flips that task's box in `tasks.md`. Never hand-edit that box or hand-author per-task JSON, and never write a per-task start. Re-closing is safe. **Batching is a defect the doctor catches**: it names any cluster of finishes stamped seconds apart, because those timestamps record when the batch was written, and history is append-only so it cannot be repaired afterwards. The per-task summaries and their order are what is trustworthy; the timestamps are best-effort, and that is fine.

  **A fanned-out worker appends only**, because folding is a read-modify-write and two folders contend:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one line>" --files "<files>" --append
  ```

  The MAIN agent folds each returned result with `--materialize`, one at a time, and once more at a wave join as a backstop.

- **Never write the next step's start.** The next command owns it; writing it here renders a phantom "Generating <next>…".
