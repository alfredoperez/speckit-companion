## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
   - Record the **plan START** so the step's duration begins now (the script stamps the real clock; the after-plan hook records the completion — do not hand-write plan timing):
     ```bash
     python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <directory containing FEATURE_SPEC> --step plan --status planning --kind start --by extension
     ```

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

5. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```
   - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Update the plan reference between the `<!-- SPECKIT START -->` and `<!-- SPECKIT END -->` markers in `__CONTEXT_FILE__` to point to the plan file created in step 1 (the IMPL_PLAN path)

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated agent context file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation and agent context files
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications


<!-- speckit-companion:part timing -->
## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Never hand-edit `.spec-context.json`.** Record every finish by **running the writer script**, never by editing the JSON file yourself — a hand-authored edit is what corrupts the file (a duplicated `status` key). The script stamps the real clock, writes atomically, and is idempotent. The commands below are the only way you touch timing.
- **Always close your own step — the after-hook is a preference, not a guarantee.** The last thing you do in a step, *after* emitting any mandatory after-hook block, is close it yourself:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <this step> --advance --by ai
  ```

  `--advance` appends the step-level complete **and** flips `status` to that step's canonical completed value, in one atomic write. It is **idempotent and first-writer-wins**: when the after-hook did dispatch, its extension-stamped close already landed and this call is a no-op that changes nothing. When the hook did *not* dispatch, this is the only thing that closes the step.

  Run it every time. `EXECUTE_COMMAND` is an instruction addressed to a runtime, and in a terminal session that runtime is you — so *dispatching the hook* and *printing the words "Executing the hook"* produce identical output and nothing downstream can tell them apart. A run once sat at `status: tasking` for eight and a half minutes with the next step unreachable because the block was printed and not run, and that stall is now permanently part of that step's recorded duration. Losing `by: extension` on the completion attribution costs nothing; losing the completion costs the run.

  For **clarify and analyze** use `--finish` instead of `--advance` — they record a boundary without owning a status:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <this step> --finish --by ai
  ```
- **Substeps — one finish each, via the script.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`), the moment that substep ends, run:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --step <step> --substep <name> --finish --by ai
  ```

  One call per substep, each stamped with its own real clock at the moment it finishes — never two substeps in one batch, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — finishing a task *is* logging it (finish-only).** Recording a task's finish is the **closing action of that task**, done the instant its work is complete and before you start the next one — not a bookkeeping pass you batch at the end of a phase. **A batch is a defect, and it is now caught:** the doctor clusters task finishes and names any group stamped inside a few seconds of each other, because those timestamps measure when you wrote the batch, not how long each task took. On one measured run 16 of 25 finishes landed under a tenth of a second apart, and implement's durations are permanently untrustworthy as a result — history is append-only, so this cannot be repaired afterwards. Implement records almost no substep boundaries by design; the per-task journal *is* its shape, which is why batching it erases the only fine-grained record the step has. The closing action is a single append (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --close-task <TaskID> --by ai --did "<one-line summary of what this task did>" --files "<comma,separated,files,touched>"
  ```

  `--close-task` appends the finish **and** folds it in one call: the line lands in `.spec-context.events.jsonl` with its own real clock (`date -u` is stamped by the script), the panel's Tasks card is populated from `--did`/`--files`, and the task's `- [ ]` box in `tasks.md` is flipped to `- [x]`. **Do NOT hand-edit that checkbox** — the script owns it. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON, and do NOT write a per-task `start`.

  Re-closing a task never double-counts, so a retry is safe.

  **A fanned-out worker closes in two halves instead.** Folding is a read-modify-write on the shared file, and two folders is the contention the append log exists to prevent — so a worker appends only:

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one line>" --files "<files>" --append
  ```

  and the MAIN agent folds each returned result with `--materialize`, one at a time. Run `--materialize` once more at a wave join as a backstop; the end-of-step hook folds anything left and fills any task you did not journal.

  What is trustworthy here is the **per-task summary** (`did`/`files`) and the order tasks completed, plus the **step-level** start→complete span, which the scripts stamp exactly. The per-task *timestamps* are best-effort: they record when each finish was written, not a measured duration. That is fine — the summaries are the point.
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".
