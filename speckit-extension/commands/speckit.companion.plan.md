## Pre-Execution Checks — stock spec-kit extension hooks

Companion runs **on top of** stock spec-kit, so a project's installed spec-kit **extensions** (git, and any others registered in `.specify/extensions.yml`) must still fire on a Companion run exactly as they do on a stock `/speckit.*` run. This is separate from Companion's own node-hooks (`.specify/companion.yml`): both fire. Like the rest of the pipeline, checking these hooks must **never fail the host command** — if anything is missing or malformed, skip silently and continue.

Let `<step>` be this command's phase: `specify`, `plan`, `tasks`, or `implement`.

**Before-hooks — run these *now*, before any of the work below.**
- Check whether `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root. If it does not, skip silently — there are no hooks.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under `hooks.before_<step>`. If the YAML cannot be parsed, skip hook checking silently and continue normally.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. A hook with no `enabled` field is enabled by default.
- Do **not** interpret or evaluate a hook's `condition` expression yourself: a hook with no `condition` (or a null/empty one) is executable; a hook with a non-empty `condition` is left to the HookExecutor — skip it here.
- For each executable hook, emit one block based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no before-hooks are registered, skip silently.

**After-hooks — run these once this command's work is fully reported, before handing off.**
- Re-check `.specify/extensions.yml`; if absent or unparseable, skip silently. Look under `hooks.after_<step>`, applying the same `enabled` / `condition` filtering as above.
- For each executable hook, emit one block:
  - **Optional** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
- If no after-hooks are registered, skip silently.

For `specify`, branch creation is normally one of these `before_specify` hooks (the git extension); spec directory and file creation are always handled by the command body itself.

## Outline

Produce an implementation plan and its design artifacts in phases: load context → write `plan.md` (Summary, Technical Context, Constitution Check, Project Structure) → Phase 0 research → Phase 1 design (data model, contracts, quickstart).
**Right-size this plan to the change.** Before anything else, read the recorded size from the spec's context — `.spec-context.json` → the `size` field (treat a missing value as `normal`). That size sets the budget for the steps below; **apply it to them, omitting anything it says to skip.**

- **`normal` or `oversized`** — produce the full plan and every design artifact exactly as the steps describe. No trimming.
- **`simple`** — a small change does not need the full ceremony. Produce a **lean** plan:
  - `plan.md`: keep the **Summary** and a **Technical Context** trimmed to the lines that shape the build (Language/Version, Primary Dependencies, Storage, Testing, Constraints — drop Performance Goals / Scale-Scope / Target Platform boilerplate). **Skip the Project Structure section** (the task list already names every file) and **skip the Constitution Check** unless there is a real violation to flag.
  - **Skip `data-model.md`** — fold the one or two types into the plan's prose. **Skip `quickstart.md`** — it would only restate the obvious.
  - Write the design rationale as a short **Key Decisions** note folded into `plan.md` (a few Decision/why lines), not a separate `research.md`, unless a decision genuinely needs its own page.
  - Generate `contracts/` only if the feature exposes an interface a consumer or test codes against.

This budget governs every step that follows. Where a later step would produce something the budget skips, omit it — do not produce it and then delete it.
1. Read `.specify/feature.json` for the feature directory; load `<feature_directory>/spec.md` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if present — the inputs the plan must satisfy. Then **investigate the codebase, in parallel when you can.** Understand where this feature attaches: the patterns it must follow (state/store, routing, persistence, component and test conventions) and the exact files it will touch. From the spec, derive the handful of **independent investigation areas** this change implicates, then — when your provider can spawn subagents — **read them concurrently: one subagent per area in a single message, each returning a distilled finding** (the pattern to copy, the concrete file paths, the conventions to match), never a dump of file contents. Collect the findings as the research basis for the plan. A host without subagents reads the areas in sequence for an identical result.
2. Create `<feature_directory>/plan.md` with these sections, in order. Lead each with prose; reserve `inline code` for real identifiers (paths, types, packages), not ordinary nouns — a sentence that is mostly code spans is a rewrite.
   - **Summary** — 2–4 plain-language sentences: the primary requirement plus the technical approach.
   - **Technical Context** — the stack as plain `Label: value` lines, each named once: Language/Version, Primary Dependencies, Storage, Testing, Target Platform, Project Type, Performance Goals, Constraints, Scale/Scope. Mark a genuine unknown `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`. Keep the values readable — don't backtick every noun.
   - **Project Structure** — the concrete source layout this feature touches, as a short tree of real directories/files, plus a one-line **Structure Decision**. Use the actual paths; do not leave placeholder option-trees in the output.
3. **Constitution Check** — add a `## Constitution Check` section to `plan.md` as a table: one row per constitution principle with a PASS / justified-violation assessment. This is a gate before Phase 0 research, re-checked after Phase 1 design. If a violation is genuinely necessary, justify it in a short **Complexity Tracking** table (violation | why needed | simpler alternative rejected). Omit Complexity Tracking when there are no violations; ERROR on an unjustified gate failure.
4. **Phase 0 — Research (first).** Write `<feature_directory>/research.md` before the Phase 1 docs, since they build on its decisions. For each unknown in Technical Context and each significant dependency, integration, or design choice, record a short entry as **Decision** (what you chose) / **Rationale** (why) / **Alternatives considered** (what else, and why not). Resolve every `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` here — this is where a maintainer sees *why* the design is shaped this way.

5. **Phase 1 — Design & contracts (in parallel).** With research settled, generate the design artifacts the size budget keeps. They are **independent documents that share no evolving state**, so — when your provider can spawn subagents — **generate them concurrently: issue one subagent per document in a single message, then collect the results.** A host without subagents writes them in sequence for an identical result.
   - `<feature_directory>/data-model.md` — the entities this feature introduces or reshapes: fields, relationships, validation rules drawn from the requirements, and any state transitions.
   - `<feature_directory>/contracts/` — the interface the feature exposes (API / CLI / schema, or a UI contract listing routes and the identifiers a consumer/test codes against). **Copy every identifier from the spec's Verbatim Constraints exactly — never rename, recase, pluralize, or invent an identifier the spec already pinned; those exact strings *are* the contract.** Skip the directory only when the feature exposes no interface at all.
   - `<feature_directory>/quickstart.md` — only when there is a non-obvious setup or verification path a developer would otherwise miss; skip it rather than restating what's already obvious.
   After the documents return, re-check the Constitution Check against the final design.

**Output**: `<feature_directory>/plan.md` plus `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md` when applicable.

## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Live timestamps.** When you append a history entry yourself, stamp it by running `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` at that moment. Never hand-type a timestamp, never reuse an earlier value, never stamp several entries with one shared value.
- **Self-close — but not specify or implement.** When your own work for **plan, tasks, clarify, or analyze** ends, append `{ "step": "<this step>", "substep": null, "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<date -u output>" }`. Do NOT self-close **specify** or **implement**: the extension closes those itself (specify from its own command, implement from the end-of-step hook), so an `ai` complete there would duplicate it.
- **Substeps — one finish each.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`) append a single finish `{ "step": "<step>", "substep": "<name>", "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<fresh date -u>" }` the moment that substep ends. One entry per substep, each with its own real timestamp — never two substeps sharing a value, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — journal each task with a script (finish-only).** As you finish each task: mark it `- [x] **<TaskID>**` in `tasks.md`, then run (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one-line summary of what this task did>" --files "<comma,separated,files,touched>"
  ```

  The `--did`/`--files` flags make the script write `task_summaries.<TaskID>` (the field the Activity panel's Tasks card reads) in the same call that records the finish — so the panel is populated by the script, NOT by a hand-authored `.spec-context.json` edit. Do NOT also hand-edit `task_summaries` yourself; the script owns it. Run this **the moment that task completes** — one finish per task, as you go. Do NOT defer journaling to the end of the step and do NOT dump every task's finish in one end-of-step batch: that collapses their real durations into a single instant, and the cadence check now FAILS a run whose task finishes are clustered into a tiny fraction of the step's real duration. This stamps **one** finish event from the real clock — its delta to the previous task's finish is that task's duration. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON and do NOT write a per-task `start`. The end-of-step hook is a backstop that fills any task you didn't journal (it won't duplicate one you did). If you do run independent tasks concurrently, the main agent still journals each as it finishes; the batch's time is attributed to whichever finishes last (accepted limitation).
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".

## Self-advance — hand off to the next step

This is one step in the Companion pipeline. How the run continues depends on the environment you are running in; do not invoke a separate headless/deterministic run command for the everyday flow.

- **On an agentic CLI that keeps acting after a step finishes:** once this step's work is complete, read the Companion workflow definition (`speckit-extension/workflows/speckit-companion.workflow.yml`) to learn which step comes next, then continue into it on your own — dispatch the next step's `/speckit.companion.*` command and keep going through the pipeline.
- **Pause at every review gate.** Where the workflow marks a `gate` (e.g. review-spec, review-plan), stop and wait for approval rather than running past it. Only continue once the gate is approved.
- **Terminal step after implement.** After the implementation step finishes (and any commit step), the workflow's final step is `mark-complete`. Run it so the spec lands at `status: completed`. That step writes `completed` only through `write-context.py --mark-complete`, which refuses unless the spec is already `implemented` — never introduce a second completed-writer.
- **Degrade gracefully on a one-shot environment.** If your environment runs one step and then stops, the handoff simply does not fire: finish this step, record its progress, and stop. The run stays valid and resumable, and the next step is triggered manually (by the developer or the companion panel). Completion likewise stays a manual action there.

## Node hooks — run the project's `before`/`after` inserts

This command is assembled from ordered **nodes**. A project can attach its own work at the boundary *before* or *after* any node by declaring it in `.specify/companion.yml`. You are the runtime: read that file (if present) and run those hooks at the right moments. Like the rest of the pipeline, this must **never fail the host command** — degrade and continue.

**Find the hooks for this command.** Look up `commands.<this-command>.hooks` in `.specify/companion.yml`. It has two anchors, `before` and `after`, each keyed by a node id from this command's order. Run a node's `before` hooks immediately before that node's work, and its `after` hooks immediately after. When several hooks sit at one anchor, run them **top to bottom, in declared order**.

**Hook types:**

- `{ type: command, run: "<shell>" }` — run the shell command with your terminal/Bash tool, then continue. *If you have no terminal tool* (some chat-only providers), do not pretend to: report the command you would have run and continue.
- `{ type: prompt, text: "<instruction>" }` — treat the text as an inline instruction and act on it before moving on.
- `{ type: node, ref: <id> }` — read `.specify/companion/nodes/<id>.md` and carry out its body as if it were part of this command.

**Background hooks.** Any hook may add `background: true`. Kick it off and continue the pipeline immediately without waiting for it to finish — it must not hold the spec prisoner. Use it for slow, independent side-effects (a test run, a build, a notification): for a `command`, launch it detached (e.g. append `&` or use `nohup … &`); for a `node`/`prompt`, do its work without blocking the next step. Report its result whenever it lands, but never block on it. **Do not** mark a `background` hook on anything that writes `.spec-context.json` (the timing/capture calls): those are fast already and run a read-modify-write on the shared file, so two of them racing in the background can lose an update. Background is for side-effects, not bookkeeping.

**Failure handling (never abort the host command):**

- **No `.specify/companion.yml`** → there are no hooks; run the command exactly as written. Do not warn.
- **The file is malformed / unparseable** → ignore it, note one short warning, and run the shipped command unchanged.
- **A hook is anchored to a node that isn't in this run's order** (e.g. a recipe dropped it) → warn once and skip that anchor's hooks.
- **A `type: node` hook's `ref` file is missing** → this is a real misconfiguration: report it clearly and stop before doing damage, rather than silently skipping.

If a hook's own work fails (a `command` exits non-zero, a `node` can't complete), report it and — unless the failure clearly makes the rest unsafe — continue the pipeline. The host command's own output is never blocked by a hook.
