## Outline

Produce a **lean** plan — just enough to drive tasks. No multi-phase research scaffolding, no dual-option structure trees.

1. Read `.specify/feature.json` for the feature directory; load `<feature_directory>/spec.md` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if present.

2. Create `<feature_directory>/plan.md` with these sections, in order:
   - **Summary** — the primary requirement plus the technical approach in 2–4 sentences.
   - **Technical Context** — language/version, primary dependencies, storage, testing, target platform, hard constraints. Mark unknowns `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`.
   - **Approach & Structure** — the concrete files/modules this touches (real paths) and the order of attack. Organize by file/dependency, not by user story. (This replaces the stock Project Structure trees.)
   - **Out of Scope** — what this explicitly does not do.

3. If the constitution defines gates, add a short **Constitution Check** (pass / justified violations). Omit the Complexity-Tracking table unless there is a real violation to justify.

4. **Side files — assess on demand.** Create each only when it genuinely helps a developer understand or build *this* change; when the information fits naturally in `plan.md`, keep it there instead of spawning a file. Judge per feature:
   - `research.md` — only for real unknowns or trade-offs worth recording on their own; otherwise fold a short "Decisions" note into `plan.md`.
   - `data-model.md` — only when the change introduces or reshapes entities a dev needs spelled out to implement it.
   - `contracts/` — only when it exposes an interface (API / CLI / schema / UI) a consumer codes against.
   - `quickstart.md` — only when there is a non-obvious setup or verification path a dev would otherwise miss.
   Default to folding into `plan.md`; create a side file only when its absence would slow understanding or implementation.

**Output**: `<feature_directory>/plan.md` (+ any side files that genuinely help: `research.md` / `data-model.md` / `contracts/` / `quickstart.md`).

## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Live timestamps.** When you append a history entry yourself, stamp it by running `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` at that moment. Never hand-type a timestamp, never reuse an earlier value, never stamp several entries with one shared value.
- **Self-close — but not specify or implement.** When your own work for **plan, tasks, clarify, or analyze** ends, append `{ "step": "<this step>", "substep": null, "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<date -u output>" }`. Do NOT self-close **specify** or **implement**: the extension closes those itself (specify from its own command, implement from the end-of-step hook), so an `ai` complete there would duplicate it.
- **Substeps — one finish each.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`) append a single finish `{ "step": "<step>", "substep": "<name>", "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<fresh date -u>" }` the moment that substep ends. One entry per substep, each with its own real timestamp — never two substeps sharing a value, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — journal each task with a script (finish-only).** As you finish each task: mark it `- [x] **<TaskID>**` in `tasks.md`, then run (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one-line summary of what this task did>" --files "<comma,separated,files,touched>"
  ```

  The `--did`/`--files` flags make the script write `task_summaries.<TaskID>` (the field the Activity panel's Tasks card reads) in the same call that records the finish — so the panel is populated by the script, NOT by a hand-authored `.spec-context.json` edit. Do NOT also hand-edit `task_summaries` yourself; the script owns it. Run this **the moment that task completes** — one finish per task, as you go. Do NOT defer journaling to the end of the step and do NOT dump every task's finish in one end-of-step batch: that collapses their real durations into a single instant, and the cadence check now FAILS a run whose task finishes are clustered into a tiny fraction of the step's real duration. This stamps **one** finish event from the real clock — its delta to the previous task's finish is that task's duration. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON and do NOT write a per-task `start`. The end-of-step hook is a backstop that fills any task you didn't journal (it won't duplicate one you did). Parallel `[P]` tasks: journal each as it finishes; the batch's time is attributed to whichever finishes last (accepted limitation).
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".

## Self-advance — hand off to the next step

This is one step in the Companion pipeline. How the run continues depends on the environment you are running in; do not invoke a separate headless/deterministic run command for the everyday flow.

- **On an agentic CLI that keeps acting after a step finishes:** once this step's work is complete, read the Companion workflow definition (`speckit-extension/workflows/speckit-companion.workflow.yml`) to learn which step comes next, then continue into it on your own — dispatch the next step's `/speckit.companion.*` command and keep going through the pipeline.
- **Pause at every review gate.** Where the workflow marks a `gate` (e.g. review-spec, review-plan), stop and wait for approval rather than running past it. Only continue once the gate is approved.
- **Terminal step after implement.** After the implementation step finishes (and any commit step), the workflow's final step is `mark-complete`. Run it so the spec lands at `status: completed`. That step writes `completed` only through `write-context.py --mark-complete`, which refuses unless the spec is already `implemented` — never introduce a second completed-writer.
- **Degrade gracefully on a one-shot environment.** If your environment runs one step and then stops, the handoff simply does not fire: finish this step, record its progress, and stop. The run stays valid and resumable, and the next step is triggered manually (by the developer or the companion panel). Completion likewise stays a manual action there.

## Node hooks — run the project's `before`/`after` inserts

This command is assembled from ordered **nodes**. A project can attach its own work at the boundary *before* or *after* any node by declaring it in `.specify/companion.yml`. You are the runtime: read that file (if present) and run those hooks at the right moments. Like the rest of the pipeline, this must **never fail the host command** — degrade and continue.

**Find the hooks for this command.** Look up `commands.<this-command>.hooks` in `.specify/companion.yml`. It has two anchors, `before` and `after`, each keyed by a node id from this command's order. Run a node's `before` hooks immediately before that node's work, and its `after` hooks immediately after. When several hooks sit at one anchor, run them **top to bottom, in declared order**.

**Hook types:**

- `{ type: command, run: "<shell>" }` — run the shell command with your terminal/Bash tool, then continue. *If you have no terminal tool* (some chat-only providers), do not pretend to: report the command you would have run and continue.
- `{ type: prompt, text: "<instruction>" }` — treat the text as an inline instruction and act on it before moving on.
- `{ type: node, ref: <id> }` — read `.specify/companion/nodes/<id>.md` and carry out its body as if it were part of this command.

**Background hooks.** Any hook may add `background: true`. Kick it off and continue the pipeline immediately without waiting for it to finish — it must not hold the spec prisoner. Use it for slow, independent side-effects (a test run, a build, a notification): for a `command`, launch it detached (e.g. append `&` or use `nohup … &`); for a `node`/`prompt`, do its work without blocking the next step. Report its result whenever it lands, but never block on it. **Do not** mark a `background` hook on anything that writes `.spec-context.json` (the timing/capture calls): those are fast already and run a read-modify-write on the shared file, so two of them racing in the background can lose an update. Background is for side-effects, not bookkeeping.

**Failure handling (never abort the host command):**

- **No `.specify/companion.yml`** → there are no hooks; run the command exactly as written. Do not warn.
- **The file is malformed / unparseable** → ignore it, note one short warning, and run the shipped command unchanged.
- **A hook is anchored to a node that isn't in this run's order** (e.g. a recipe dropped it) → warn once and skip that anchor's hooks.
- **A `type: node` hook's `ref` file is missing** → this is a real misconfiguration: report it clearly and stop before doing damage, rather than silently skipping.

If a hook's own work fails (a `command` exits non-zero, a `node` can't complete), report it and — unless the failure clearly makes the rest unsafe — continue the pipeline. The host command's own output is never blocked by a hook.
