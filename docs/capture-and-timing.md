# Capture & Timing Architecture

How `.spec-context.json` gets written, why some of it is exact and some of it is best-effort, and what the eval asserts. Read this before touching capture hooks, the timing partial, the preset bodies, `write-context.py`, or `check_capture.py` — it exists so the flow doesn't have to be re-derived from the code each time.

## The two capture mechanisms

Every entry in `history[]` comes from one of two surfaces. They differ in *who* writes and in *how reliable* the timing is.

### 1. Deterministic writes — exact, ~100% reliable

The extension or a script writes these; nothing depends on the AI's judgement.

| Trigger | Code | `by` | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GUI lifecycle button (sidebar/viewer) | `src/features/specs/stepLifecycle.ts` → `specContextWriter.ts` | `extension` | step `start`/`complete`, `setStatus`, `setProfile` (atomic temp+rename) |
| Command-body self-capture | the companion `specify`/`implement` bodies call `write-context.py --kind start`/`--kind complete` | `extension` | **specify** start (right after the dir is created) + complete (at the end) → a real begin→end span; **implement** start (at begin) |
| `after_implement` hook | `write-context.py --tasks-file` → `sync_tasks()` (run by `speckit.companion.capture-implement`) | `extension` | a **single finish** per task not already journaled (finish-only backstop), then the implement step's **complete** — all stamped with the script's own clock |
| Other lifecycle hooks | `write-context.py` (run by `speckit.companion.capture*`) | `extension` | step **start** (plan→planned, tasks→ready-to-implement, …) |
| Reconstruction fallback | `speckit-extension/scripts/derive-from-files.py` | `derive` | state rebuilt from on-disk artifacts when a hook never fired (same start+complete shape) |

These carry **sub-second (ms) precision** because they read the real clock at write time, and they are monotonic because they fire in order.

### 2. Best-effort AI journaling — coarse, NOT guaranteed

The **timing part** — authored once in `speckit-extension/presets/_parts/timing.md`, assembled into every companion preset command body by `build-commands.py`, and injected into the GUI dispatch preamble by `src/ai-providers/promptBuilder.ts` — *instructs* the AI to append entries with `by: "ai"` using a live `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`, for the steps the scripts don't own:

- **Self-close — plan/tasks/clarify/analyze only.** When one of those step's own work ends, append `{step, substep:null, kind:"complete", by:"ai", at:<date -u>}`. **specify** and **implement** are deliberately excluded — they are closed deterministically by scripts (see §1), so an `ai` complete there would duplicate the script's.
- **Substeps live.** Each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`) appends its own entry the moment it finishes.

Per-task timing is journaled **live by the AI via a script** (finish-only): after each task it runs `write-context.py --task <id> --kind complete`, appending **one** finish event per task. Because a script stamps it, this carries **ms precision** and honest deltas (the gap between consecutive finishes is each task's real duration) — not hand-authored JSON. The `after_implement` hook is the backstop that fills any task the live path missed (§1). The remaining genuinely-hand-authored `by:ai` entries — the plan/tasks/clarify/analyze self-closes and the single-finish substep boundaries — carry **second precision** and are only as accurate as the AI's discipline allows.

## Why the split exists (the dispatch model)

The extension dispatches a command as **text** — to a terminal, the host editor's chat, or the Claude GUI panel — and **receives no completion callback**. It cannot observe "the AI finished this step at time T." So the only timing signals the host can trust are:

1. **GUI button clicks** — user-driven, host-observed → deterministic.
2. **In-command hook scripts** — the AI runs them at a fixed point in the command (the "check for extension hooks" step) → deterministic-ish (depends on the command reaching that step, which it reliably does).

Anything finer than a step boundary — a step's *real* end time, per-task cadence — has no host-observable signal. The fix (applied 2026-06-08) is to move that capture off the AI and into **scripts the command runs**: the specify body brackets itself with `--kind start`/`--kind complete` calls, and the `after_implement` hook journals every task + the implement close. The script reads the real clock, so these are deterministic even though the host never saw the step finish.

## The reliability principle

> **"Run a script" is reliable. "Author JSON with an embedded live timestamp" is best-effort.**

The AI executes commands faithfully — every lifecycle hook fired on every run. It is far less reliable at pausing mid-work to hand-author a JSON entry with a freshly-shelled `date -u`. The lever for raising fidelity is therefore to **convert timing capture from "AI authors JSON" to "AI runs a script that stamps its own clock"** — the script reads the real time (ms precision, no hand-typing, no format drift), and calling a script is the kind of action the AI does reliably.

This principle is also what the eval encodes: deterministic writes are held to a strict bar; AI-journaled timing is graded as quality, not pass/fail.

## Fixed — deterministic timing (2026-06-08)

Both gaps the financial-page E2E exposed were closed by moving capture off the AI (see the reliability principle above):

- **specify now self-closes.** The specify body calls `write-context.py --kind start` right after it creates the dir and `--kind complete` at the end (`by:extension`, ms precision) → a real begin→end span instead of a `complete` synthesized at plan-start. The late `after_specify` hook-start is collapsed by the broadened start-dedup in `update_context` (a step is started once).
- **per-task no longer bursts.** The AI stopped hand-authoring per-task JSON; the `after_implement` hook's `sync_tasks()` writes each task with the script's own clock.

The remaining `by:ai` writes are the plan/tasks/clarify/analyze self-closes and substep boundaries. History: `Projects/speckit companion/backlog/specify-duration-and-duplicate-start.md`.

## Finish-only journaling (2026-06-08, v2)

The 2026-06-08 fix above made per-task capture *reliable* (the hook owns it) but at the cost of *cadence*: writing a `start` **and** a `complete` for each task at one end-of-step instant produces `0s` ticks (start == complete) and a burst (all tasks share a tight window). v2 moves to a **finish-only** model that recovers honest cadence without re-introducing hand-authored JSON:

- **One finish per task/substep.** A task or substep records a *single* `complete` event — never a start+complete pair. Its duration is the gap to the previous finish (the first measured from the step's `start`). No pair → no `0s` tick; deltas → no unattributed inter-task gap.
- **Live, via a script.** The AI runs `write-context.py --task <id> --kind complete --by ai` as it finishes each task (the live path). A script stamps it, so it is reliable *and* honest (ms precision, real deltas). Substeps emit one hand-authored finish each.
- **Backstop hardened.** `sync_tasks()` writes finish-only too and now journals per-task **even when implement already self-closed** (`status: implemented`): its guard was narrowed from `TERMINAL_STATUSES` to `CROSS_STEP_TERMINAL` (`completed`/`archived` only), so a same-step write is never rejected. `_journaled_tasks` keeps it from duplicating a task the live path captured.
- **Parallel `[P]` caveat.** The delta model can't give each task in a parallel batch its own duration — the batch is attributed to whichever finishes last. Accepted for the common sequential case.
- **Derivation.** `src/features/specs/stepHistoryDerivation.ts` (`buildSubsteps`) computes each row from finish deltas, staying tolerant of legacy start+complete pairs and single boundary markers. A per-task row is named from `task` (or a legacy `substep` mirror); the derivation compares `task` so two distinct finishes don't collapse, and excludes task entries when deciding whether the step itself is closed.
- **Both dispatch surfaces.** The instruction lives identically in `presets/_parts/timing.md` (spec-kit path, assembled into the bodies by `build-commands.py`) and `src/ai-providers/promptBuilder.ts` (GUI path); `check-shape-parity.py` guards against a fork. The relocation from `_shared/timing-partial.md` to `_parts/timing.md` changed only where the block is authored — the bytes the AI receives, and therefore the capture, are unchanged.
- **Both marker formats.** Per-task detection accepts the Companion **bold** form (`- [x] **T001**`) *and* the stock tasks-template **plain** form (`- [x] T001 …`) — `parse_task_markers` (`write-context.py`) and the eval make the `**` optional. Previously the bold-only regex silently no-op'd on a stock `tasks.md`, so the spec got no per-task journal and implement never auto-closed. The TS/GUI task-percent already counted plain checkboxes, so only the Python parsers needed it.

## Record-shape hardening (2026-06-09)

Finish-only made the timing honest; this pass makes the record *self-describing* and the eval able to *catch* a dishonest one. Two moves: tighten what the writers emit, and add the checks that verify it.

- **Dropped redundant fields.** The writers no longer emit three things that carried no new information: the **`from`** pointer on `start` entries (fully derivable from the previous entry's step), the per-task **`substep` mirror** of `task` (the id already lives in `task`, so per-task implement finishes are now `{step:"implement", substep:null, task:"T001", kind:"complete", …}`), and the date-only **`updated`** marker (strictly less precise than the ms-stamped `history[]` `at` values, and no reader consumed it). This applies to all three write sites: `write-context.py`, `derive-from-files.py` (the one-shot combined-artifact path), and the GUI `specContextWriter.ts`.
- **Backward-readable, not migrated.** Records written before this change still carry `from`/`updated`/substep-mirror. The schema keeps `additionalProperties: true`, so those validate as undeclared extras; readers (`stepHistoryDerivation.ts`, `historyHelpers.ts`, the Python `_entry_kind`/`_has_complete`) degrade cleanly when `from` is absent and `substep` is null for tasks. New writers stop *adding* these fields; a record that already carries `from`/`updated`/the substep-mirror keeps them — those are preserved, not stripped (append-only history never rewrites past entries; the read-merge preserves unknown top-level keys). Only legacy `transitions`/`stepHistory` are actively dropped.
- **Cadence-span FAIL + format validation.** The eval gains `task-cadence-span` (the burst detector) and `entries-match-format` (per-entry schema validation) — see *The eval* below.
- **Schema is the single vocabulary source.** `check_capture.py` loads its `by`/step/status enums *from* `spec-context.schema.json` instead of hard-coding parallel lists, so the eval can't drift from the format authority.

## Fast-path lifecycle fold (2026-06-09)

The Companion complexity fast-path — the command-body fold described here (**on by default**, no flag), and separately available as the [Companion workflow routing step](./template-profiles.md#companion-workflow-routing-step) — folds the plan and tasks steps into the `specify` run for a small change. The same pass also emits three lean files — `spec.md` (inline Approach), a `plan.md` pointer, and a real-checklist `tasks.md` — so the file-driven stepper, sidebar, and implement progress agree with this history fold rather than reading "not created". After `specify` self-closes, the simple-mode branch records the folded steps so the history panels read them as satisfied (not missing) instead of dispatching separate `/speckit.companion.plan` / `.tasks` runs:

- **`--substep` flag.** `write-context.py --step <plan|tasks> --kind <start|complete> --substep fast-path` tags the folded step-level entries with `substep: "fast-path"` instead of `null`. The fold is four ordered calls — `plan` start/complete then `tasks` start/complete, the last adding `--status ready-to-implement` — each stamped by the script's own clock (`by:ai`, real timestamps), so the spec lands at `ready-to-implement` in one run.
- **Idempotent on (step, substep).** `_has_step_start` / `_has_complete` dedup on the `(step, substep)` pair, so a folded `fast-path` start/complete never collides with a real step-level (`substep:null`) entry and a re-run never doubles the fold.
- **Eval coverage.** `check_capture.py` asserts a fast-tracked spec's folded `plan`/`tasks` start+complete entries (tagged `fast-path`), real timestamps, and final `ready-to-implement` status — and stays silent on a normal spec.

## Companion workflow run/resume capture (#292)

The Companion pipeline can run as a single spec-kit workflow (`specify workflow run speckit-companion`) on spec-kit's own engine instead of hand-invoked commands — see [`template-profiles.md`](./template-profiles.md#companion-workflow-routing-step). Capture is **unchanged** by this path: the engine dispatches each step's command (`speckit.companion.{specify,plan,tasks,implement}`) exactly as a hand-run would, so the same lifecycle hooks and command bodies fire and write `.spec-context.json` the same way. The two timing models above still hold — deterministic step writes from the hooks, finish-only per-task journaling inside implement.

- **Run/resume keep capture honest.** A workflow run pauses at the review gates and resumes from the exact node with `specify workflow resume <run_id>`; because capture is per-step (not per-run), a resumed run continues writing the canonical `history[]` from wherever it stopped — no step is re-captured or skipped.
- **Terminal `mark-complete`.** The workflow's final step dispatches `speckit.companion.mark-complete`, which calls `write-context.py --mark-complete` — the only sanctioned writer of `status: completed`. It promotes a spec from `implemented` to `completed` (a path `update_context` refuses, since `implemented` is terminal to it), keeps `currentStep: implement`, and is idempotent for an already-shipped spec. The AI never hand-writes `completed`. It also accepts a spec still at `implementing` whose `tasks.md` is **100% checked** — that spec is finished in fact, so it advances `implementing → implemented → completed` in one atomic write (closing the implement step in history). A spec with work left is still refused, so incomplete work can never be shipped. The companion side of this fix has a partner: finishing the last task no longer re-asserts `implementing` (it lands the spec at `implemented`), so the live per-task path and the `sync_tasks` backstop converge on the same closed state.
- **Engine run state is separate.** The engine persists its own run bookkeeping under `.specify/workflows/runs/<run_id>/` (state, inputs, a copy of the workflow). That is the engine's resume substrate; the Companion GUI still reads only each spec's `.spec-context.json`.

## Implement-lifecycle reliability (#277)

The implement step's *settle* (reaching `status: implemented`) is the most fragile link end-to-end — it has no "next step" to trigger its close, IDE-chat dispatch returns no terminal handle, and stock mode has no companion hook. Three guards make it reliable regardless of dispatch mode or which spec is "active":

- **Fallback settle from the always-on `tasks.md` watcher (#244).** The deterministic settle is *no longer owned solely* by the `after_implement` hook. The extension's `tasks.md` watcher (`src/core/fileWatchers.ts` → `shouldCloseImplement` → `completeStep(specDir, 'implement', 'extension')`) writes the implement self-close **and** `status=implemented` (via `deriveCompletedStatus('implement')`) the moment every marker in `tasks.md` is checked under an underway implement step. This is the one mode-agnostic surface, and it targets the file-watched path, so a missed hook can no longer strand a finished implementation at `implementing`. It is guarded against re-close / fast-path-park / backward-clobber by `shouldCloseImplement`.
- **Capture writer settles the spec named by `--tasks-file` (#277 Child 2).** In task-sync mode, `write-context.py` derives the feature dir from the **`--tasks-file` parent**, overriding the active-feature pointer precedence (`SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` → `SPECIFY_FEATURE` → `.specify/feature.json` → git branch). The tasks file's spec dir is authoritative: the spec whose task list is passed is the spec that settles, so settling spec 16's implementation can never land on spec 17 because a later spec is "active". When both `--feature-dir` and `--tasks-file` are supplied and disagree, the writer **refuses to write** (prints the mismatch to stderr, exits 0) rather than silently picking one. `resolve_feature_dir` is unchanged for step-mode and `--task` finish-mode. Covered by `TasksFileResolvesFeatureDirTests` in `speckit-extension/tests/test_context.py`.
- **Viewer refresh over configured spec dirs (#277 Child 3 / #270).** A `.spec-context.json` watcher fires for every configured spec directory (`**/<pattern>/**/.spec-context.json` from `getFileWatcherPatterns`, wired in `fileWatchers.ts`) → `refreshContextIfDisplaying`, so the open viewer re-derives within a debounce window when implement settles (the legacy `.claude`-only watcher missed the default `specs/` layout). The same watcher's `onDidCreate` refreshes the sidebar, and `.specify/specs` is now in the default `specDirectories`, so a spec created under the CLI's `.specify/specs/` layout is discovered and clears the welcome screen.

## Preset / command-override mechanism

The document *shape* (stock SpecKit vs Companion) and the timing partial both live in **command-body overrides**, not template files — core commands embed their own structure, and template overrides don't reach `specify` (it copies its template by literal path).

- The stock shape is the stock command bodies carried by the **`companion-standard`** preset (`speckit-extension/presets/companion-standard/`), which `replaces:` the **7** command bodies (`type: command`): specify, clarify, plan, tasks, analyze, implement, constitution. The Companion shape is delivered by the namespaced `/speckit.companion.{specify,plan,tasks,implement}` commands (the extension's `provides.commands`). **Both families are always present** — neither is gated on a mutually-exclusive preset.
- Selected by the **workflow choice** `speckit.defaultWorkflow` (`speckit` | `companion`), recorded per spec in `.spec-context.json` `workflow`. Selection is **dispatch routing, not a preset swap**: each step resolves its workflow's command via `resolveStepCommand`, then `src/features/specs/profileDispatch.ts` `resolveDispatchWithFallback` downgrades a `/speckit.companion.*` command to its stock twin when the extension is missing; the choice adds/removes nothing.
- `specify preset add --dev <bundled path>` **re-emits the agent command bodies** (e.g. `.claude/skills/speckit-specify/SKILL.md`) with the overridden body. To confirm `companion-standard` is active, check that `.specify/presets/companion-standard/` exists **and** the re-emitted body carries the timing partial — **not** `specify preset resolve`, which reports *template* overrides only and prints "No template…" for these `type: command` overrides (not a bug).
- **Both shapes carry the identical timing partial** → switching the workflow changes the document shape, **not** the timing capture. A Companion run shows the same timing behavior as a stock SpecKit run.

See `docs/template-profiles.md` for the full workflow reference.

## Activation ensure (keep the stock family present)

On activation the extension runs an **add-only** ensure — `companionPresetReconciler.ensureStandardFamily` — that adds `companion-standard` from the bundled path (`specify preset add --dev .specify/extensions/companion/presets/companion-standard`) when the stock command files are absent, and is a no-op when present. The `--dev` bundled path is required because catalog-form `add <id>` silently no-ops (the presets aren't published to a catalog). The ensure **never** removes the stock family, so it cannot strand a project: it re-materializes the stock commands on a fresh checkout and recovers a project a prior swap left without them. A one-time migration removes a leftover `companion-turbo` install if present (and the pre-rename `companion-lean` / `sdd-lean` leftovers); the workflow choice itself issues no removes thereafter. CLI failures are logged, not thrown, so activation never breaks.

## Install paths

Capture scripts run from the **installed** extension dir, `.specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py` — never the dev-source `speckit-extension/scripts/…` (that path doesn't exist in a consumer project). The hooks reference the installed path (mirroring the git extension's `.specify/extensions/<id>/scripts/…` convention).

## The eval

`.claude/skills/eval-speckit-extension/check_capture.py` is the regression net (a tracked project skill — edit it here, it is **not** sourced from kaiju). It bakes in the reliability principle:

- **`timestamps-real` / `timestamps-monotonic`** apply strict checks only to **deterministic** writes (`by:extension`/`derive`/`cli`/`user`): those must be ms-precision and non-decreasing. `by:ai` second-precision and occasional burst is **expected**, reported as cadence quality — not a failure.
- **`per-task-no-duplicates`** pairs by `(task, kind)`: finish-only means a task carries a single `complete` (a `start` may still appear on legacy specs). Only a repeated `(task, kind)` is the real dedup-failure signal (the backstop re-adding a task the live path already journaled).
- **`task-cadence`** reports its source: `live (by:ai, script-stamped)` (non-zero gaps are the honest-cadence signal) vs `backstop (by:extension, end-of-step)` (near-zero gaps acceptable, not a defect).
- **`task-cadence-span`** is the **burst detector** (the FAIL that `task-cadence` couldn't be). It compares the span of `by:ai` task finishes (first→last) against the implement step's *real* `start`→`complete` duration. When ≥ 3 ai finishes span less than **`MIN_CADENCE_SPAN_PCT` (5%)** of the step, the run FAILs — that is a batch dumped at the end masquerading as live cadence (the spec-136 baseline: 13 finishes across 0.22% of a 6m40s step). Non-zero gaps alone pass the old `task-cadence` info row, so this span ratio is what actually catches the burst. `by:extension` backstop finishes are exempt — the end-of-step hook legitimately clusters.
- **`entries-match-format`** validates **every** `history[]` entry against the schema's `historyEntry` definition (required keys present, `step`/`kind`/`by` in enum, `substep` string|null, `task` a string when present, `at` parseable). A single malformed entry FAILs the run.

The eval **loads `CANONICAL_STEPS` / `CANONICAL_STATUSES` / `VALID_BY` (and the entry `required` list) from `src/core/types/spec-context.schema.json`** at startup (walking up to the repo root), falling back to inline constants only if the schema is unreadable. The schema is the single vocabulary source, so the eval's allowed-value lists cannot drift from the format definition. When the capture model changes, update both this doc and the eval in the same change — but the enums now follow the schema automatically.
