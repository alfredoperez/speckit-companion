- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The specification leverages VS Code's documented webview theming capabilities
- No clarifications needed - the feature scope is well-defined based on observed behavior and user request
- **Updated 2026-01-01**: Added User Story 3 (Compact Layout), FR-009 through FR-011, and SC-006/SC-007 for header spacing and empty line hover fixes
