# Specification Quality Checklist: Footer next step matches the pending step

**Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
**Created**: 2026-08-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses
- [x] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- The Verbatim Constraints section carries exact identifiers the request pinned. That is the one sanctioned place for them; the body stays implementation-free.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers: every open choice was resolved into an informed default and recorded under Assumptions.
