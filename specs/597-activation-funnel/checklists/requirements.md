# Specification Quality Checklist: Activation Funnel

**Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
**Created**: 2026-08-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses (none needed: the issue's one open choice, FR-016, carries an informed default recorded under Assumptions)
- [x] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (already-shipped epic pieces excluded; dashboard responsibility split recorded)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- Verbatim Constraints deliberately carry the issue's pinned identifiers (event names, proof line, welcome copy) — these are user-pinned requirements, not implementation leakage.
- Self-check pass complete: all items pass; no spec updates required before clarify or plan.
