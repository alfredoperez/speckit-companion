# Specification Quality Checklist: Remove orphaned "Mark step complete" override chain

**Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
**Created**: 2026-06-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user/business value and the change's intent
- [x] Overview states what is delivered and why in 1–3 sentences
- [x] All four sections present (Overview, Functional Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses
- [x] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] Edge cases are folded into Functional Requirements or Assumptions
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Every Functional Requirement maps to at least one Success Criterion
- [x] Overview intent is reflected by the FR list (no orphan goals)
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- This is a cleanup spec; FRs name code regions for traceability but the success criteria stay technology-agnostic (search-result counts, build/test pass/fail, doc presence).
