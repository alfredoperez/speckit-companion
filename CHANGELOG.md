# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-31

### New Features

- **Workflow Commands**: Workflows can now define `commands` — extra action buttons that appear next to the primary action for a given step (e.g., an "Auto Mode" button next to Submit in the spec editor) (#45)
- **Action Toast & Auto-Navigate**: Spec viewer now shows a toast notification after running an action and automatically navigates to the next workflow phase (#44)

### Bug Fixes

- **Terminal Timing**: Replaced fixed 800ms `setTimeout` with VS Code's shell integration API (`onDidChangeTerminalShellIntegration`) for detecting terminal readiness before sending commands — prevents commands from being lost on slow shell startup (#46)
- **Extension Host Cleanup**: Audited all disposables in `activate()` to ensure clean shutdown without "closing extension host" warnings

### Improvements

- **Shell Integration Fallback**: Terminals on VS Code versions below 1.93 (lacking shell integration events) gracefully fall back to a 5-second timeout
- **Shared Utility**: New `waitForShellReady` utility used consistently across all 5 AI providers and steering manager

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-26

### New Features

- **Scoped Related Docs**: Related documents in the spec viewer are now scoped to their parent workflow step (#38)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-26

### New Features

- **Optional SpecKit CLI**: Extension now works without SpecKit CLI initialization (#35)
- **Copilot permission mode**: New `speckit.copilotPermissionMode` setting to control auto-approval (`yolo`/`default`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Copilot CLI command**: Replaced `ghcs` (shell suggestion tool) with `copilot` CLI — the correct coding assistant executable (#36)
- **Copilot non-interactive mode**: Added `-p` flag for prompt mode and `--yolo` for auto-approving shell actions
- **Copilot slash commands**: Strip leading `/` from prompts since Copilot CLI doesn't use slash commands

### Improvements

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Bug Fixes
